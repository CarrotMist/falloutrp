ITEM.desc = "A craft metal armor created from a variety of scrap pieces put on a black leather armor. The metal helmet is similar in shape to a motorcycle helmet, though with a dirty silver color instead of white, as well as no neck wrap or goggles for males, and for females, the helmet is made of rusted metal and is open faced, similar in shape to combat helmets (although it still muffles the user's voice while worn). The shoulder plates have metal spikes welded onto them."
