ITEM.desc = "Chinese stealth armor, also known as Hei gui stealth armor, was one of China's greatest military assets during the Sino-American War. When equipped, it afforded the soldier a high amount of protection (but not as much as America's combat armor), while also coating the user in an active camouflage system. The American Army tried to copy this technology in the unstable Stealth Boy units. The scientists from the Big MT tried to copy the results in their stealth suit Mk II."
